**About Me**

- I am a programmer obsessed with programming languages. A few worthy mentions: Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), C++, JavaScript, C, Python, Bash, Rust, Haskell, Dart and looking into more. 

Let's connect? I am interested in building tools the software community needs to make programming more environmentally sustainable.
