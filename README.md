👋 Welcome to @TheodoreAI's GitHub Profile

About Me:

- 🎓 Currently pursuing a Master's of Engineering at Oregon State University, with a focus on high-performance computing.
- 💻 Professionally experienced in front-end and back-end software development.
- 📚 Continuously learning and improving my technical skills, currently using C/C++ with [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131103628/ref=nosim/cboard-20) & [Programming Principles and Practice Using C++](https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/fef0590f02fa06bb42cba558fbc9e51c.pdf) to test Monte Carlo Simulations and Fourier Analysis on High Performance Computing clusters.
- 🤝 Eager to collaborate with open-source communities and contribute to project I am interested in academically and professionally.
- 📩 Feel free to reach out to me via email at mateoej12@gmail.com.


My philosophy to software engineering is that if I don't know something, I can learn it.

Let's connect and build something we could use together.
