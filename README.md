👋 Welcome to @TheodoreAI's GitHub Profile

About Me:

- 🎓 Currently pursuing a Master's of Engineering at Oregon State University, with a focus on systems engineering (computer graphics, high performance computing, human computer interaction), and interpersonal communication - because the difficult part of engineering a new project is agreeing on project requirements across stakeholders.
- 💻 Professionally experienced in front-end and back-end software development.
- 👨‍🔬 Academic experience with data science in the context of marine-bio [for more info](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.220242)
- 📚 Continuously learning and finding ways to improve both technical and interpersonal skills, currently using C/C++ MPI (message process interface) to test Monte Carlo Simulations and Fourier Analysis on High Performance Computing clusters. 
- 🤝 Eager to collaborate with open-source communities and contribute to projects in high performance computing, new programming languages, or JavaScript libraries.

- 📩 Feel free to reach out to me via email at mateoej12@gmail.com.



Let's connect and build something the community could use to make our lives easier.
