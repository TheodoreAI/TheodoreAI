Hi, I am a Physics and CS grad. My primary interests are programming languages and quantum mechanics. I have a bunch of repos with projects at various stages of development. Some are plain projects in order to evaluate the pros and cons of programming libraries or programming languages. My other GitHub account is @MateoEstradaOSU - where I write all my professional projects in the domain of web development.
