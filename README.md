**About Me**

- I am a programmer obsessed with programming languages. A few worthy mentions: Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), C++, JavaScript, C, Python, Bash, Rust, Haskell, Dart and looking into more. 

Let's connect? I am currently using Haskell for exploring functional programming and leveraging its abstraction syntax for constructing mathematical models for higher dimensional numbers such as quaternions and octonions. The end goal is a simple higher dimensional number library.
