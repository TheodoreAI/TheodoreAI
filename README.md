My primary interests are programming languages, 2D and 3D graphics, and creating forms. I enjoy using math and physics to create 3D graphics. Feel free to checkout my repos. They are all projects at various stages of development. Some are plain projects in order to evaluate the pros and cons of programming libraries or programming languages. My other GitHub account is @MateoEstradaOSU - where I write all my professional projects for fields like biology, sociology, anthropology, fish and wildlife, and more. 

The fun part of CS is how other fields can be used in CS. 

Fun things I like to work with:
- Shaders (opengl) - fragment, vertex, tesselations, geometry 
- Using Python to avoid excel
- JavaScript in the server
- C++ Programming in computer graphics and high performance computing

This started as a hobby of building a small webpage for a barbershop and a tattoo parlor. And well it has grown into more. 

I have always been drawn to a good webpage. 

Oh and I am getting my Masters Degree cause I want to become better at this whole thing. 
But also so I can officially call myself an engineer, not that that matters cause in our field the work speaks for itself.
Anyways, that is pretty much this slice of my life. Feel free to follow or reach out. I am always on the lookout for the next big idea that will capture me for the next 6 months.
